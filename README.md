Braille Keyboard

This is a little project I started because I got interested in accessability measures for blind
people, like Braille, audio-only games, etc. This program can be used by sighted people to learn
Braille. It turns the homerow keys into a Braille keyboard, i.e. the "f", "d", "s", "j", "k", and
"l" keys represent dots 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 of a standard six-dot Braille cell, respectively.
Unicode characters representing Braille cells are displayed in the window when typed.


Things To Do:

 -Insert characters instead of overwriting.
 -Add load/save file i/o.
 -Add help document.
